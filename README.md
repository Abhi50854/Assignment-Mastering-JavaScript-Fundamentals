# Mastering JavaScript Fundamentals

## Overview

This project is a hands-on introduction to core JavaScript concepts. It demonstrates how to use variables, conditionals, functions, loops, and DOM manipulation to create dynamic and interactive web content. By exploring each part, you’ll gain practical experience in JavaScript fundamentals.

## Features

The project is divided into four main sections:

### 1. JavaScript Basics

* Declares variables such as `userName` and `userAge`.
* Uses conditional statements to check the age and display whether the user is an adult or a minor.
* Output is dynamically displayed in the HTML element with `id="part1"`.

### 2. Functions

* Demonstrates creating reusable functions:

  * `addNumbers(a, b)` — adds two numbers.
  * `greet(name)` — returns a formatted greeting.
* Shows results directly in the HTML element with `id="part2"`.

### 3. Loops

* Uses a `for` loop to count from 1 to 5.
* Uses a `while` loop to perform a countdown from 5.
* Loop results are displayed in the HTML element with `id="part3"`.

### 4. DOM Manipulation

* Selects HTML elements and interacts with them using JavaScript.
* Implements interactive buttons:

  * `Change Text` — updates the text content.
  * `Toggle Color` — toggles a CSS class to change text color.
* Dynamically creates and appends a new paragraph to the DOM.
* Output appears in the HTML element with `id="part4"`.

## File Structure

```
project-folder/
│
├─ index.html       # Main HTML file
├─ style.css        # CSS for styling the page
└─ script.js        # JavaScript file handling functionality
```

## How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
2. Observe:

   * Part 1: Displays a message based on age.
   * Part 2: Shows the result of functions.
   * Part 3: Displays counting and countdown sequences.
   * Part 4: Provides interactive buttons and dynamically added content.
3. Interact with the buttons in Part 4 to see real-time DOM manipulation.

## Styling

* Uses basic CSS for fonts and spacing.
* `.red` class changes text color to red and makes it bold.
* Part 4 paragraph has larger font size for emphasis.

## Learning Outcomes

By completing and experimenting with this project, you will:

* Understand JavaScript variables, conditionals, loops, and functions.
